 Word Web is a daily word game to find anagrams for a group of seven letters.

*How to play:*
Find English words with at least 4 letters that are anagrams. Each day will have at least 1 pangram, or word with all seven letters. All words in the list must have the center letter.

*Scoring*
Four-letter words are worth one point each, five-or-more-letter words are worth one point per letter. Any pangram is worth its letters + seven bonus points.





### MVP



Users should see a new group of 7 letters each day, and should be able to enter words. For a given word, it will be accepted or rejected. The game will list all correctly guessed words in alphabetical order, and will have a progress bar that progresses as the user guesses words.



### Optional Features:

1. "Helper" to show a grid containing how many words remain grouped by length and starting letter, that is updated dynamically
2. "Hover" over a word to get a definition
3. German-language option
4. History*
5. Native
